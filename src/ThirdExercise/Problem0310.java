    /*
    整除查询
    Description
    Given an array of positive integers and many queries for divisibility.
    In every query Q[i], we are given an integer K , we need to count all elements in the array which are perfectly divisible by K.
    Constraints:1<=T<=1001<=N,M<=1051<=A[i],Q[i]<=105

    Input
    The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.
    First line of each test case contains two integers N & M, second line contains N space separated array elements and third line contains M space separated queries.

    Output
    For each test case,In new line print the required count for each query Q[i].
