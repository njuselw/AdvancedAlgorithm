    /*
    和为定值的子数组
    Description
    Given an array A of size N, find all combination of four elements in the array whose sum is equal to a given value K.
    For example, if the given array is {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 7, 8} and K = 23, one of the quadruple is “3 5 7 8” (3 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 23).

    Input
    The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases.
    Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two lines. The first line of input contains two integers N and K.
    Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array.（1<=T<=100；1<=N<=100；-1000<=K<=1000；-100<=A[]<=100）

    Output
    For each test case in a new line print all the quadruples present in the array separated by space which sums up to value of K.
    Each quadruple is unique which are separated by a delimeter "$" and are in increasing order.
